Based on version 26 of the plain storage tank
	Version 26 = Second validation using LBNL data
Adding an equation to change the gas => flue convection coefficient depending on average tank temperature

Validation
	TWatAvg should be the average of all of the segment temperatures. Is it?
		Yes
	hGasFlu should equal TWatAvg^2 + TWatAvg + 1. Does it?
		Yes
