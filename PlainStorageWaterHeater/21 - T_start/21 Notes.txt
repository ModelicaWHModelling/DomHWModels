Originally set with only one T_start value. All segments had same T_start
	Changed code to allow user to enter T_start vector, specify a T_start for each segment
	Also changed convection coefficients to give a better calibration (h_GB and h_CV_F changed so that T_F better matches exp data)
Also changed T_F equation
	Previously calculated temperature of T_F[i] based on T_WL[i]
		Makes no sense. First term used to identify how much heat had been removed from the gas. Needs to reference temp of segments below i
		Changed to use T_WL_avg[i:nSeg]
Results look good!
	Now much closer match in terms of time burner is on

Future changes
	1. Remembering hearing at HWF (...William...? Retired, used to work for a manufacturer) that baffles are designed to cause constant heat transfer along flue wall
		Need to creat algorithm which modifies h_cv_F with location in flue. Goal being to keep Q_gas=>wall constant
		This change would increase Q_wall=> water at higher segments, would likely make top seg data more closely match experimental data
	2. Definitely need to change model to work more accurately when burner is off (pilot only operation)
		Currently calculates T_F0_y to be -1400 C
			But is this a problem? T_F ends up being ~60 C (close to T_WL). How does this compare against data?
			Data (end of 24 hr test): 54 C at bottom, 46 C at top. Sim (end of 24 hr test) ranges from ~46 C to 50 C. Numbers look good. Out of order though (T_F[nSeg] > T_F[1])
