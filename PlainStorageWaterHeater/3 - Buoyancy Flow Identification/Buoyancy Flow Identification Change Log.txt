Improved heaBuoTra
	Added class used to calculate the mass flow rate into a segment caused by buoyancy
	Improved calculations over Thierrys version to not overwrite each other (should get different results)
		How to check results? Sum(m_flow_F) = Sum(m_flow_in)
	Modified spaghetti code in tan to accept new inputs and not repeat calculations
Did NOT replace if statements with smoothing

Next step
	Current version runs slowly: Switch to using smoothing functions instead of "if" statements
	Move mass balance equations (m_Flow_D) into buoHeaTra
