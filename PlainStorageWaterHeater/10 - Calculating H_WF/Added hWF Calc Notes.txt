Notes
	Created new model to calculate hWF
		No longer convinced this is a good idea
			Creates many simulation headaches
			Need to carefully massage to get simulation to run - runs into problems with being unable to solve, too high residual
			11 numerical jacobians (hWF calculation impacts most everything, is not linear, is based on Gr which is not linear)
		Is there a more simplified way which can approximate but is easier on Modelica?
