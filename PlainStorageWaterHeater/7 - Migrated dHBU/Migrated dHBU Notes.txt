Notes
	Created new model called dHBU. Calculates dHBU as part of buoHeaTra
	Changes some references in dHBU calcs
		i+1 switched to i-1
		Some loops were 1:i. Should have been 1:nSeg. Replaced
	Calculations performed as Real values; no units. Want to improve model by changing that
		How can I pass values from one model to another, containing temperature and/or flow rate values?
Next Steps
	Calculate Q_Flow_Tot in buoHeaTra
