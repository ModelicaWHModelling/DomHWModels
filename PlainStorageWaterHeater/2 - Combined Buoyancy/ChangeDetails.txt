Began work on converting spaghetti code into visual representation. Combined buo_B and buo_F into a combined model called buoHeaTra. Intending to eventually pass out Q_Flow_Tot from that class, all calcs contained within

Steps Completed
1) Create buoHeaTra class
2) Move buo_B and buo_F into the class

Next steps
1) Add code calculating m_flow_BU for each segment
2) Calculate mass balance inside buoHeaTra
3) Calculate Q_Flow_Tot
