Changed parameters in storage tank and burner to use values identified in calibration
	Values not very good; could not achieve good calibration due to "lost heat" effect. Details later
Added calculations for mDotC. Identifies height of straitification layer based on dt >= 1 C, changes mDotC above/below
Believed this version of the model will not work
	ADL equations only work if tank is well mixed. Otherwise buoyancy eqns lose heat (see pg 60, Water Heater Model Notes)
	Cannot both keep perfect mixing (to avoid losing heat) and allow stratification layer to develop
		Tried varying both mDotC and c_wI. c_wI is unable to generate enough mixing, mDotC must be too high for stratification layer to ever form
Next Steps:
	1) Redevlop buoyancy/mixing equations to use a much simpler method
		a) Identify location of boundary layer based on dT >= 1 C
		b) Sum all heat below stratification layer
		c) Divide heat below strat layer among all segs below strat layer
		d) Add heat directly to all segs above strat layer (QFlu = QSeg)
