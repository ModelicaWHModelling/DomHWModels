Was using Modelica standard library prescribed heat flow model
eqn => Q_port = - Q_flow * (1 + alpha * (TPort - TRef))

alpha was set to 1e6. Was causing massive change between input Q_flow and Q_Port
Need Q_port = -Q_Flow. That is the equation in the buildings library version
Changed component to be buildings library version

Note: No longer simulates. Temperature keeps falling below 0, causing error. UA losses are huge
	Is construction wrong?
	What is TAmb?
