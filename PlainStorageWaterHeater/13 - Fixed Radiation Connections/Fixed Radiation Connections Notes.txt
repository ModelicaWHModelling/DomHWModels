The two radiation models in the tank model had connections reversed
	Two connections each: T_In, u
		T_In describes the ambient air temperature
		u is a function of the surface (Absorptivity)
	T_In was connected to u, u connected to T_In
	Reversed the connections
		No longer losing 1.5 kW per segment to the ambient conditions
		Simulations no longer erroring out because TWat < 0 after time
Notes:
	Buoyancy calcs seem suspicious when burner is off
	Bottom segments suddenly start gaining lots of buoyant heat -> Why? There shouldn'y be much to gain!
		mC...?
		mD? Looks like mFloFlu is constant (which seems wrong...) which causes mD when potentially there shouldn't be one
