Changes
	Changed buoHeaTra calculations to also share ambient losses through the top of the tank
		Causes top segment to stay much closer to the rest of the segments in temperature
		Still some error; in some cases top seg loses temp faster than others. Not understood when/why
Still to work on
	Simulation can get very slow in some situations
		Most notably when draw occuring at same time as burn
		Understand why, improve
	Investigate when/why top segment cools off faster than other segments
		Improve
