Notes
	Based on conversation with Dr. William (Bill) R. Hoover
		Stated that baffles are typically designed to produce even heat transfer along the flue
	Attempting to create an algorithm which results in nearly identical heat transfer along the flue
		First through: Calculate T_F_avg and use in all sections
		Hopefully this will yield better results in the top segments of the tank (Above the stratification layer)
