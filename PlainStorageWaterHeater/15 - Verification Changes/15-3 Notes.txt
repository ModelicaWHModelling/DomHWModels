Was previously double counting the heat transfer from the flue and the base
	Method
		Flue and base heat transfer came in through convection models and heat ports. Applied directly to connected segments
		Flue and base heat transfer also mentioned in buoyancy calculations. Used to identify buoyancy flows, temperatures, and add heat to a higher segment
			Nowhere was it handled that the buoyant heat was leaving the segment
		Added terms subtracting the flue and base heat transfers into buoHeaTra
			Assumption: heat enters via heat port, leaves via buoyancy
	Verification
		Used qBuo example model to check results
			Added a connecting 100 each seg for QFlu, 100 bot seg for QBas
			Without the code subtracting QFlu&QBas results were 15W for each seg (equal to the hard-coded 15W for dHBU)
			Added code
				Seg 1,2 (of 3) reported -85 (15-100)
				Seg 3 (of 3) reported -185 (15-200)
