Previously there was no term describing the heat leaving a segment caused by mDotD
	Added a term to all segments (except the bottom, because it has no mDotD)
		-mDotD * c_p * (T_Seg - T_SegBelow)
	Verification
		When the temperature of all segs are identical has no impact
		Changed the temperature of specific segments. Correctly calculated heat flows with new term
