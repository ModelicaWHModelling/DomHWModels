Previously there was an error in dHBU for nSeg
	Was calculating dHBU_F_In twice. The first was correct, the second was not and overwrote the first
		Was originally calculated using the second equation. A change was made intending to remove the first equation, replace with the second. The first was never deleted
		Caused heat to enter the last segment via buoyancy in situations when it should not
	The equations have been fixed, the buoyant heat flow entering nSeg is now 0 when it should be
