Previously the convection coefficient between the gas and the base of the tank was represented by a real expression = 2
	Added the parameter h_GB, put h_GB into the realExpression
	Results sensitive to h_GB implying that the addition/connection is correct
		Is this more complicated than necessary? Do we want to have h_GB and h_cw_B be the same? Not going to be able to identify the two (limits of experimental data, can't really measure Q_gas->base and Q_base->water)
