Notes
	Removed all unneccsary, commented out code in the tank model
	Moved T_F calculation from algorithm to equation. Doing so removed the numerical jacobian
		Does T_F in the new one match T_F in the old one?
			Yes
	Also changed bandwidth on controller to 8C (roughly 15 F per Jim Lutz)
	Current version can end up running very slowly
		If T_H is very close to TWat may rapidly switch between > and <
		Dramatically slows down the simulation
		How can this be improved?
			May be OK for the GTI version, something to worry about for PIER
