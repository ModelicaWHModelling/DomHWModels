Motivation
	The more detailed model was very problematic, and seemed to be overly complicated
		Several complications did not seem to add any value (example: Detailed wall construction rather than a UA value
		The method of identifying gas temperature in the flue and using convection coefficients to identify heat transfer into the water did not work
			Convection coefficients which caused flue temperatures to match resulted in ~50% less heat transfer into the water than test data showed
		Also requires uneccessary inputs - convection coefficients between water and tank wall, tank wall and air. Only going to have a total UA value available!

Plan
	Create model in a manner similar to the simplified tank used in hybrid model (actually, start using hybrid model)
	Primary change from hybrid model: Use the bottom up heat buoHeaTra instead of the top down fluHeaTra
