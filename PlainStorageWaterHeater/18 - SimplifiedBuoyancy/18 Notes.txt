Changes
	Removed all ADL buoyancy calculations
	Replaced with a new methodology
		1. Identifies location of a stratification layer based on dT(Seg(i) - Seg(i+1)) > 0.5 C
		2. Takes all flue/base heat below stratification layer and divides it evenly among all segments below strat layer
		3. Flue heat added above strat layer is added to its specific segment
Things to look into
	1) Do the equations work right when a segment is above the stratification layer? Should get heat directly from the flue
		Doesn't this mean that buoHeaTra[i] = 0 for segs above stratification layer?
		Checked: Works 99% right. Some error caused by smoothing functions identified. Need to eventually include logic to remove smoothing error, but OK for now
	2) Check +/- signs on all terms. Make sure they are correct
Next Steps
	1) Make connections to storage tank using fluid ports
		Allows input/output to be a real fluid with mass flow rate, temperature, pressure
		Then can include a boundary condition external pressure for thermal expansion reasons
