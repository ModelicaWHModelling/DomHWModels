Notes
	Using version 25 - AddedMixingAlgorithm as base while characterizing/validation model
	Changed thickness (x) of insulation material from 0.002 to 0.013
		Losses to ambient (no pilot) now match
	158W used for pilot light input. Taken from beginning of Test8
	10515W used for burner input. Taken from first burn in Test8
	T_Set = 46 C. See pg 24 of Water Heater Experiments
	T_Deadband = 12 (+/-6) deg C. See pg 24 of Water Heater Experiments
Additions
	Added a model, QEle, which models fan energy consumption
		Uses two electricity consumption rates: Idle and active
		Switches between the two depending on whether the burner is idle/active
	Added a second example, StorageTankWithFan, which uses QEle
