This folder contains all of the work done on modeling residential water heating systems to date. Within this folder the user will find several subfolders. Each subfolder will contain another readme file describing the files and folders contained within that folder.

The valuable subfolders here are:

CombinedWaterHeatingLibrary: This is the current development folder in the WaterHeatingLibrary. Originally the models were each housed in separate folders (such as CondensingStorageTank and CondensingTankless), but were later merged into a single folder. The folders were merged to make it easier to combine all spearate models into a single dymola package. The package is located in CombinedWaterHeatingLibrary.

ExperimentalData: This folder contains all experimental data collected during this project. It only contains original LBL data, and does not include experimental data from other people's research.

All of the other folders are considered to be obsolete, and are saved for backup reasons.
