This folder contains files which are used in the characterization and validation process. The files in thise folder are:

CalibrationInput.csv: This file is used to store parameter values in the characterization process. The file "CombinedWaterHeatingLibrary/Scripts/TanklessModelOptimizationScript.mos" both reads from and writes to this file. When the script begins a calibration process (using the "Calibration" function) it reads in the value of each parameter from CalibrationInput.csv. It then uses the "Calibration" function to optimize the results by changing the value of a single parameter. After the "Calibration" function finishes, the script writes the final value of the parameter to CalibrationInput.csv overwriting the existing value of that parameter. The script then reads the new value set from CalibrationInput.csv, and runs the "Calibration" function for a different parameter and continues to repeat the process as defined in TanklessModelOptimizationScript.mos.

Rheem84DVLNRepeatedDrawsCharacterization.csv: This is an experimental data file used in the characterization process. It contains measurements taken on a Rheem 84-DVLN tankelss heater. The values in the table represented the natural gas consumption rate, in terms of energy use (W), and the temperature of the water leaving the heater (deg C). These experimental results were used as the "right" answer when performing characterization on the tankless water heater model.
