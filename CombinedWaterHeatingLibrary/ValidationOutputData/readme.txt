This folder contains output data files from characterization and validation simulations. The files are results from simulation models, to save the data and plot it later. The files are:

Rheem84DVLNPICCharacterization.txt: This file contains simulation results using the controller PID constants identified during the characterization process. It provides simulation data which can be compared to experimental data for use in the validation process.

ValidationResults.txt: This file contains simulation results from simulating the validation test protocol. Not mentioned in the title of the file, this data is from the simulation of the tankless water heater. The heater in the file is the Rheem 84DVLN.
