This folder contains scripts which are used in the WaterHeatingLibrary. The files in this folder are:

HotAndColdDisWithTankless.mos: This is a script to run an example file in the WaterHeatingLibrary. A detailed description is located in WaterHeatingLibrary.CombinedExamples.HotAndColdDisWithTankless.

TanklessWithTrunkAndBranch.mos: This is also a script to run an example file. A detailed description is located in WaterHeatingLibrary.CombinedExamples.TanklessWithTrunkAndBranch.

TanklessModelOptimizationScript.mos: This is an example script which can be used to repeatedly run the "Calibration" function in Dymola. The "Calibration" function is used to perform a simulation, compare the simulation results to experimental data, vary a parameter in the model, and repeat the process. TanklessModelOptimizationScript uses the "Calibration" function for several parameters, as well as a for loop, to optimize the model for a number of different parameters. Comments in the script described in more detail the programming of the script.
