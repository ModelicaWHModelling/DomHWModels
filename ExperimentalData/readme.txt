This folder contains sub-folders filled with experimental data. Each subfolder represents an individual water heater. The tested heaters are as follows:

A.O. Smith GCF-40-100: This is a residential non-condensing storage tank type water heater. It has a 40 gallon storage capacity, 40 kBtu/hr heat rate, 0.67 energy factor, and an automatic flue damper. The flue damper is typically closed to reduce thermal losses out of the flue during standby periods, and opens as needed during a burn. A spec sheet for the heater can be found at: http://www.hotwater.com/water-heaters/residential/conventional/gas/promax/high-efficiency-flue-damper-gas-tank-water-heater-gcf-40/

A.O. Smith GPNH-40: This is a residential non-condensing storage tank type water heater. It has a 40 gallon storage capacity, 42 kBtu/hr heat rate, 0.68 energy factor, and a Power Vent fan (fan assisting exhaust gases through the flue). The fan it typically off and turns on to enhanve ventilation when the burner is active. A spec sheet for the heater can be found at: http://www.hotwater.com/water-heaters/residential/conventional/gas/promax/promax-ultra-low-nox-power-vent-gas-tank-water-heater-gpnh-40/

RheemFuryModel22V40FN: This is a residential non-condensing storage tank type water heater. It has a 38 gallon capacity, 0.60 energy factor, and a 72 gal first hour delivery rating. It does not have any special features (such as an automatic flue damper or power vent). A spec sheet for the heater can be found at: http://www.rheem.com/documents/fury-gas-fury-ultra-low-nox-gas-spec-sheet

A.O. Smith GNR-40-200: This is a residential, non-condensing, storage tank type water heater. It has a specialized burner to meet Ultra-Low NOx standards. It has 40 gallons of storage capacity, 40 kBru/hr heat rate, 0.62 energy factor. It does not have any special energy efficiency features, only the low NOx burner. A spec sheet for the heater can be found at: http://www.hotwater.com/search.aspx?keywords=GNR&x=0&y=0

A.O. Smith GPHE-50-100: This is a residential, condensing, storage tank type water heater. It uses a downward helical flue for the condensing heat exchanger to achieve a high thermal efficiency. It has 50 gal storage capacity, 76 kBtu/hr heat rate, 90% thermal efficiency (NOT The same as energy factor). A spec sheet for the heater can be found at: http://www.hotwater.com/water-heaters/residential/conventional/gas/vertex/power-vent/

Rheem 84-DVLN: This is a residential, non-condensing tankless type water heater. It is a fully modulating unit, able to add any heat rate between 11-180 kBru/hr. It has an EF rating of 0.82, and a minimum water flow rate of 0.26 gpm.
