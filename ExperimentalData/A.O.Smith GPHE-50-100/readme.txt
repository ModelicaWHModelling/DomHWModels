This folder contains experimental data collected during tests on an A.O. Smith GPHE-50-100 water heater. The files in this folder are described below:

A.O. Smith GPHE-50-100 Notes.txt: This file contains some basic notes on the design of the A.O. Smith GPHE-50-100 water heater.

A.O.SmithGPHE-50-100RepeatedDraws.txt: This file contains data from the Repeated Draws test. This test was performed using the protocol described for the AO Smith GNR-40-200 Draw Mixing.txt file (Only, in this case, the name of the test is more honest!). The description for that file is copy/pasted here, but the readme file from the AO Smith GNR-40-200 folder should be consulted for the most up-to-date version of the description. The phases of the test are:

	1. Pre-conditioning: To prepare the tank for the test, the water in the tank was brought to the set temperature. The water was considered to be at the set temperature when the burner ceased 			firing. The tank was then allowed to sit for 10 minutes, to ensure that any water flow in the tank during the burn had stopped. 

	2. Draw mixing: After the 10 minute delay a draw was initiated. During the draw cold water flowed into the bottom of the tank. The goal of this phase was to identify how the cold water mixed into 			the bottom of the tank.

	3. Draw & burn mixing: When the water fell below the setpoint, the burner began firing. At this point, water is still flowing and the burner is firing. There are potentially two sources of water 			flow (draw flows, buoyancy flows caused by the heat transfer) currently causes turbulence and mixing in the heater. This situation was allowed to continue for 5 minutes, giving the
		opportunity to study how these two effects impact each other.

	4. Burn mixing: After the five minute period mentioned in "3." the water flow was stopped. During this phase the burner burner brought the water in the tank back to the setpoint. The recorded 		temperature data allows study of how the water in the tank mixes when only the burner is active.

It was assumed that the draw mixing effects are a function of flow rate, so this protocol was performed at three different flow rates.

A.O.Smith GPHE-50-100 Plugged Flue UA.txt: This file contains water temperature measurement data at several different heights in the tank during a UA loss test. A UA loss test consists of letting the heater sit overnight, with the burner turned off, and observing how much the temperature of the water in the tank decreases. It is referred to as a "UA loss" test because the test is used to identify the parameter "UA" which defines the heat loss rate from the water to the ambient environment.

A.O. Smith GPHE-50-100 Validation Protocol.txt: This file contains experimental collected when the validation test was performed on the GPHE-50-100 heater.
