There is only one data file in this folder. It is from an experiment performed to help Jeff Maguire of NREL. He's working on a project studying the the pilot light heat rate and the proportion of thermal losses passing out of the flue (as opposed to passing through the jacket of the heater). The file, titled OpenFlueStandyLosses, is the result of an experiment studying the heat loss to ambient with the flue open.
