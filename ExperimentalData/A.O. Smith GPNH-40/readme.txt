This folder contains experimental data collected during test performed on a n A.O. Smith GPNH-40-200 water heater. The files in this folder are as follows:

A.O. Smith GPNH-40-200.txt: This file contains some basic information on the water heater itself.

A.O. Smith GPNH-40 Mixing.txt: This file contains experimental data collected during a test protocol consisting of several draws. The test protocol is the same as the one described in the A.O. Smith GNR-40-200 folder. For the sake of ease finding the information, the description is copied from that file to this one; however, the readme file in A.O. Smith GNR-40-200 should be consulted for the most up-to-date version of the description. The steps in the test protocol are:

	1. Pre-conditioning: To prepare the tank for the test, the water in the tank was brought to the set temperature. The water was considered to be at the set temperature when the burner ceased 			firing. The tank was then allowed to sit for 10 minutes, to ensure that any water flow in the tank during the burn had stopped. 

	2. Draw mixing: After the 10 minute delay a draw was initiated. During the draw cold water flowed into the bottom of the tank. The goal of this phase was to identify how the cold water mixed into 			the bottom of the tank.

	3. Draw & burn mixing: When the water fell below the setpoint, the burner began firing. At this point, water is still flowing and the burner is firing. There are potentially two sources of water 			flow (draw flows, buoyancy flows caused by the heat transfer) currently causes turbulence and mixing in the heater. This situation was allowed to continue for 5 minutes, giving the
		opportunity to study how these two effects impact each other.

	4. Burn mixing: After the five minute period mentioned in "3." the water flow was stopped. During this phase the burner burner brought the water in the tank back to the setpoint. The recorded 		temperature data allows study of how the water in the tank mixes when only the burner is active.

It was assumed that the draw mixing effects are a function of flow rate, so this protocol was performed at three different flow rates.

A.O. Smith GPNH-40 UA Losses Plugged Flue.txt: This test used water temperature measurements at various points in the storage tank to characterize the heat loss rate from the tank. It is referred to as a "UA Losses" test because the data was used to identify the value of the UA parameter which drives the heat loss to ambient conditions. In this case, the flue was plugged removing heat loss through the flue and reducing it to only the heat loss through the jacket.

A.O. Smith GPNH-40 Mixing LowFlow.txt: This file contains data from a mixing test performed at low flow rates. The low flow rate draw was collected in a separate test because it allowed the opportunity to switch water flow meters, and use a flow meter which is more accurate at low flow rates but damaged at higher flow rates.

A.O. Smith GPNH-40 UA Losses OpenFlue.txt: This file contains test data from another "UA Losses" type test. In this case, the flue was not plugged. This test allowed for identification of the UA parameter during normal operation. Comparing these results to the results in the plugged flue test allows the user to identify the heat loss rates through the jacket of the tank and out the flue separately.
