A.O. Smith GNR-40-200 Notes.txt: This file contains some basic facts about the heater (such as storage capacity and energy factor).

AO Smith GNR-40-200 Draw Mixing.txt: This file contains experimental data collected during a "Draw Mixing" test. The "Draw Mixing" test protocol was determined to study how water mixed in the bottom of the storage tank both during a draw, and when the burner was firing. It consisted of the following phases:

	1. Pre-conditioning: To prepare the tank for the test, the water in the tank was brought to the set temperature. The water was considered to be at the set temperature when the burner ceased 			firing. The tank was then allowed to sit for 10 minutes, to ensure that any water flow in the tank during the burn had stopped. 

	2. Draw mixing: After the 10 minute delay a draw was initiated. During the draw cold water flowed into the bottom of the tank. The goal of this phase was to identify how the cold water mixed into 			the bottom of the tank.

	3. Draw & burn mixing: When the water fell below the setpoint, the burner began firing. At this point, water is still flowing and the burner is firing. There are potentially two sources of water 			flow (draw flows, buoyancy flows caused by the heat transfer) currently causes turbulence and mixing in the heater. This situation was allowed to continue for 5 minutes, giving the
		opportunity to study how these two effects impact each other.

	4. Burn mixing: After the five minute period mentioned in "3." the water flow was stopped. During this phase the burner burner brought the water in the tank back to the setpoint. The recorded 		temperature data allows study of how the water in the tank mixes when only the burner is active.

It was assumed that the draw mixing effects are a function of flow rate, so this protocol was performed at three different flow rates.

AO Smith GNR-40-200 UA Loss Open Flue.txt: This test was performed for a joint study between LBNL and Jeff Maguire at NREL. The data was used to study the portion of heat loss out of the jacket of the heater vs out of the flue. This test measures the water temperature at several points in the tank overnight, as the water is allowed to cool without the burner operating. During this particular test the flue was not plugged, and the pilot light was turned off.

AO Smith GNR-40-200 UA Loss Plugged Flue.txt: This test was performed for a joint study between LBNL and Jeff Maguire at NREL. The data was used to study the portion of heat loss out of the jacket of the heater vs out of the flue. This test measures the water temperature at several points in the tank overnight, as the water is allowed to cool without the burner operating. During this particular test the flue was plugged to remove buoyant air flows out of the flue, and the pilot light was turned off.

AO Smith GNR-40-200 UA Loss Pilot On.txt: This test was performed for a joint study between LBNL and Jeff Maguire at NREL. The data was used to study the portion of heat loss out of the jacket of the heater vs out of the flue. This test measures the water temperature at several points in the tank overnight, as the water is allowed to cool without the burner operating. During this particular test the flue was not plugged, and the pilot light was left on.
