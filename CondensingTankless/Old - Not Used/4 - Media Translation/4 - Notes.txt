Media used in the ThermoPower library are not compatible with the buildings library
	Specific problem: The flue gas model in CombustionChamber from ThermoPower does not contain the information necessary for condensing calculations in WetCoilCounterFlow from Buildings
		Need to create a model between the two which converts from ThermoPower.FlueGas to Buildings.MoistAir
Changes
	Ended up changing CombustionChamber model to a less complicated version
	Now ignores calculations for gases in the flue gas, only identifies MX[Water]
Next Steps
	Model is once against showing up as singular. No idea why this has suddenly become the case again. Shown at top level. Try breaking into smaller components, hope to localize
