Problem
	Simulation currently errors out because the gas in the combustion chamber is calculated to be at 30K
		CLEARLY not correct - Expect somewhere between 350 C and 1000 C when burning
				      Expect somewhere between TAmb and 1000 C when not burning (decay from T_Burn to T_Amb between burns)
Possible Causes
	Low gas/air flow rate
		No - despite 1000 kg/s gas and 20000 kg/s air flow gave exact same answer
	Sensitive to T_amb?
		No - 2000 C TAmb still resulted in 30 K gas temp
	Changed coding for MM - Changed incorrectly?
		No - returning to their code generated the exact same answer
	Simply an issue with initial conditions?
		No - Set T_Start (any/all) to 2000 C and got the exact same result
	Impacted by outlet conditions? (Outlet is currently a volume with a given pressure, T_default)
		No - Set outlet temperature to 2000 K, no change
	Impacted by heat transfer coefficient in combustion chamber and combustion chamber surface area?
		No - Switched between 0 and 10000^2 with no change
	Occurs at t = 0. Is this a simulation or initialization problem?
		Trying different initialization options
			initOpt = ThermoPower.Choices.Init.Options.noInit => 30 K
			initOpt = ThermoPower.Choices.Init.Options.steadyState => Different error message!
				Complains about array dimensions not matching. Appears to be nonCon.port_a2
			initOpt = ThermoPower.Choices.Init.Options.steadyState.NoP => Complains about singular calculation in comCha
			initOpt = ThermoPower.Choices.Init.Options.steadyState.NoT => Same as NoP. Cannot calculate comCha.gasOut.m_flow
			initOpt = ThermoPower.Choices.Init.Options.steadyState.NoPT => Unsupported initialization option
				The strange part: .NoT should have given this result as well. Why did it not?
			Appears that 30 K flue gas problem can be solved with initialization options. Also, steady state would be the best assumption
				Unfortunately, SteadyState assumption creates other problems
		Continuing using SteadyState assumption
			Unable to calculate FlueGas.T using function ThermoPower.Media.FlueGas.T_HX
				Claims incorrect number of array dimensions
				Checking inputs, appears to not be true. Has same number of inputs as function requests
					So...why?
				Mass fraction input appears suspicious. Instead of taking value uses cat(1, X, {1-sum(X)})
					Not sure what this means/implies. Could it dislike the format of X in ThermoPower.Media.FlueGas?
					What does "cat" mean/do?
