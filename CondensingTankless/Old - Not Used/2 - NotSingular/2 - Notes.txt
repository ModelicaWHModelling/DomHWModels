Notes
	Added parameters at top level used to describe WetCoilCounterFlow and CombustionChamber
	Structurally singular for type...BOOLEAN!?
	Still structurally singular even when only WetCoilCounterFlow included in model
		Used exact same mediums as in example file for the heat exchanger
		States structurally singular for type Real
		Don't understand; talk to Michael on Tuesday
