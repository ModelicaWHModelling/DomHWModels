Notes
	This model is able to use both the combustion chamber model from the ThermoPower library and the WetCoilCounterFlow heat exchanger from the Buildings Library
	Includes modified models (CombustionChamber) and modified media (FlueGas) in an attempt to make the models communicate
		Edited CombustionChamber to use different media
		Edited the FlueGas model used in CombustionChamber to include the values needed by WetCoilCounterFlow (Water integer, enthalpyOfLiquid, enthalpyOfCondensingGas)
	Model in current state does not simulate. Structurally singular (ACK!)
