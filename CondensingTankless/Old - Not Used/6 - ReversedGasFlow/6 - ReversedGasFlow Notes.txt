Studying the problem
	Water flow rate, natural gas flow rate, air flow rate all set to +
		Under these conditions there is no way that gasOut.m_flow <= 0 unless there is an error in the simulation
		Likely caused by modifications to CombustionChamber, specifically removing calculations of certain elements so that MoistAirUnsaturated could be used
	Plan
		Return CombustionChamber to how it was originally, use ThermoPower.Media.FlueGas in that model
		Create another model which converts between FlueGas and MoistAirUnsaturated
			Use a m_dot, T flow source (if it exists to describe MoistAirUnsaturated. Might have to use P,T
			How do I pull those values out of FlueGas?
Solution
	As described in Plan
	Connected a boundary condition to inlet port for FlueGas
		Referenced port_a.T, port_a.h, etc in flow source for MoistAirUnsaturated

New Problem
	When attempting to simulate errors out
		Gas in the combustion chamber calculated to be 30 K (!!!!) which is out of acceptable range for the medium (200 K -> 6000 K)
		Based on experimental observations, would expect somewhere between 350 C and 1000 C
		Gas temperature does not appear to be sensitive to...anything (ambient temperature, gas/air flow rate, outlet conditions)
			...What?
			Could it be calculating incorrectly because I changed the way MM is referenced in CombustionChamber?
