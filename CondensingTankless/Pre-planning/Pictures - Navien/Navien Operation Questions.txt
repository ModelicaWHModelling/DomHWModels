Bypass line
	After entering the unit the mains water will either flow to the condensing heat exchanger or through the circulation pump to the outlet
		How is this controlled? When/Why does it flow to the outlet? How can this be measured?
Hot gas path
	The burner is at the top of the heat exchangers and, presumably*, flows down from top to bottom
		*Makes sense this way. Counterflow arrangement. Coldest gas at the bottom, with the condensing heat exchanger
	Is downward flow correct? Follow flow path
	How does it get out the bottom of the condensing HX and back out the top of the heater (Flue is at top)?
	Where does condensate go?
